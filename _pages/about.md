Welcome! I am a social science researcher based in Madrid.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Social and Political Sciences from the [European University Institute](http://www.eui.eu/DepartmentsAndCentres/PoliticalAndSocialSciences/Index.aspx). I have also been a postdoctoral researcher at the [Berlin Social Science Center](https://wzb.eu/en) and at the [Geschwister-Scholl-Institut](https://www.gsi.uni-muenchen.de/index.html). 

With a background in [economics](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/utrecht-university-school-of-economics-use) and [international relations](https://www.ibei.org/en/master-international-relations), I have a multidisciplinary approach to my areas of interest, which span across the fields of comparative politics, political economy, and political sociology.

My work has been published in <i>West European Politics</i>, <i>Party Politics</i>, <i>Nations & Nationalism</i> and <i>Cambridge University Press</i>, among others. You can have a look at my [publications](/research) and my profile on [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QOsowRMAAAAJ) and [Researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Guillem_Vidal/), where most of my work can be dowloaded in open access.


<!--Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.-->
